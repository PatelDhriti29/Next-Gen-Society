# Next-Gen-Society
NextGenSociety is a web-based Smart Housing Society Management System designed to simplify society operations by digitizing notices, billing, complaints, and resident services, improving communication, transparency, and efficiency for administrators and residents. The system includes resident registration with role-based login, a notice and announcement module, maintenance bill generation and tracking, payment record management, complaint submission with status tracking, and an emergency contact directory. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database, the application can be installed by cloning the repository, running npm install, creating a .env file with MONGO_URI and PORT=3000, and starting the server with node server.js to access it at http://localhost:3000. Developed by  Dhriti Patel, and Jeel Patel, the project aims to evolve further with features like online payments, visitor management, facility booking, and mobile app support.
